About makepro

    Makepro  was  originally  inspired  by  Prof.  Chung-Yang Huang's makefile
    environment  which manages packages, automatically generates dependencies,
    compiles  C/C++  codes,  and   archives object codes into library. Makepro
    started  out  with the need of addtional automatic supports on lex/yacc, a
    more  customizable  layout,  package  dependency  handling,  and  external
    library  support.  It has undergone a few years of changes and was finally
    rewritten in Nov 2011 and published its first internal version.

    Makepro currently supports automactic compile and dependency generation on
    C/C++,  Qt  (Q_OBJECT .h),  CUDA  (.cu),  lex (.l), and yacc (.y) sources,
    customizable  package  compiling  flags, and customizable archived library
    and shared library building.


Usage

    Executing makepro-<version>.run will produce a directory named 'makepro/'.
    Under makepro/ there are four makefile related files.

        Makefile  - the main makefile which is reponsible for adding packages,
                    compiling packges, and building libraries.
        common.mk - common environment layout and compiler flags.
        macro.mk  - macro routines and functions.
        setup.mk  - customizable packages, libraries, and modes.

    Below describes the steps for creating packages.

    1)  Customize  layout. To customize layout under packages, edit 'INC_DIR',
        'SRC_DIR', and 'BIN_DIR' variables in 'common.mk'. 'INC_DIR' indicates
        where  header files are placed. 'SRC_DIR' indicates where source files
        are  placed.  Supported source file suffixes are .c, .cpp, .l, .y, and
        .cu.  'BIN_DIR' indicates where binaries are placed. Default is 'bin'.
        These  three  variables  can  be  set  to '.', which means in the same
        directory of the package.
        To  customize top level layouts, edit 'PKG_TOP', 'LIB_TOP', 'INC_TOP',
        and  'BIN_TOP' variables in 'common.mk'. These represent the top level
        package, library, include, and binary directories, respectively.


    2)  Add new packages. To add new packages, type the following.

            $ make add ADD="<pkg>..."

        Package names can contain hierachy.

            i.e. $ make add ADD="util/common_util util/graph_util"

        will  create  two  packages  'util/common_util'  and 'util/graph_util'
        under 'PKG_TOP' directory.


    3)  Add  sources.  To  add  sources,  either create new files or just copy
        source codes from other places to 'SRC_DIR' under each package.


    4)  Compile  settings.  Add packages to be compiled to 'PKGS' variables in
        'setup.mk'.

            i.e. PKGS = util/common_util util/graph_util

        Other settings are described in 'setup.mk'.


    5)  Build. To build all packages.

            $ make

        To build specific packages.

            $ make PKG="<pkg>..."

        To build all libraries.

            $ make lib

        To clean all generated files.

            $ make clean

        To clean all generated files of specific packages.

            $ make clean PKG="<pkg>..."

        To clean all libs.

            $ make libclean

        To clean all generated files and directories.

            $ make distclean
